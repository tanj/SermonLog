* Traversal Contexts
This section describes the resource tree with each sub section being
the next part of the tree

** admin/
   ModelAdminContext: (Former TopContext)

This section will be for administrating the sqlalchemy model data in
a very rough and direct fashion. A list of the sqlalchemy models
linked to their ModelContext 

*** <modelname>.<pager>.<filter>/
    ModelContext:

list model data in a paged list with links to edit, delete and create
new. Simple filtering is also enabled.

**** <primarykey=id>
     ItemContext:

Fieldset to edit item

**** new
     NewItemContext:

Empty field set to create a new item

** presenters/
   PresenterListContext:

List of presenters

*** <id>/firstname-lastname
    PresenterContext:

firstname-lastname is given for search engine optimization

*** new
    NewPresenterContext:

create a new presenter

** presentations/
   PresentationListContext:

*** <id>/dash(title)/
    PresentationContext:

info on the presentation

**** export/
   ExportContext:

The main reason right now for collecting this data is to be able to
export it for the proper tagging of mp3 files and the automatic
sermonaudio form submission

***** mp3
   ExportMp3Context:

***** sermonaudio
   ExportSaContext:


*** new
    NewPresentationContext:

create new presentation


** search/
   SearchContext:

Search isn't easy. I may need a bunch of ways to divide this
up. Thinking of some kind of recursion or chaining sequence

search/<biblebook>.<chapter>.<verse>/<event type>/<presenter search>

would return the same results as

search/<presenter search>/<biblebook>.<chapter>.<verse glob>/<event type>

Multiple sections of the same type would OR
